# POC Python Voice Agents

## Package manegement
[Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Setup local realtime test
- Setup environment `cp .env.sample .env` add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Install dependencies `uv sync`
- run `python realtime/local/push_to_talk.py`
- If you want to change how the agent behavior, change the instructions in `realtime/local/prompt.py`

## Setup Streamlit
- Setup environment `cp .env.sample .env` add your keys:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
  - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
  - `PHONE_NUMBER_FROM`
- Install dependencies `uv sync`
- If you want to test SMS messages, your twilio keys should be from a premium account
- If you want to test phone calls, run `python realtime/api/call.py` to serve the api
- Run `streamlit run server/home.py` 
- To make the call, click the button in the home page.
- To test the conversation capability and tool usage go to the `tools`page.
- If you want to change how the agent behavior, change the instructions in `server/prompts/user_call.py`

## Setup Realtime + Function Calling
- Setup environment `cp .env.sample .env` add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Update `config/personalization.json` to fit your setup
- Install dependencies `uv sync`
- Run the realtime assistant `uv run forge ` or `uv run forge  --prompts "Hello, how are you?"`

We decided to create a integration with telegram because its easy to use, we can send messages to the user in real time and its FREE!

For now, those values are hard-code for the POC, but we can change it to a configuration file in the future.

More informations on how to get the chat_id and the bot token, see [this link](https://gist.github.com/nafiesl/4ad622f344cd1dc3bb1ecbe468ff9f8a#get-chat-id-for-a-private-chat)


### CLI Text Prompts
You can also pass text prompts to the assistant via the CLI.
Use '|' to separate prompts to chain commands.

- `uv run forge  --prompts "Hello, how are you?"`


### Tools Framework
Tools are functions defined in `modules/tools.py` that extend the assistant's capabilities. These tools are mapped in `function_map` and are available for the assistant to perform actions based on user requests. The assistant uses these tools to execute specific tasks, enhancing its functionality and allowing for dynamic interactions.


## Mock Database (sqlite and duckdb)
- Reset sqlite `rm db/mock_sqlite.db && sqlite3 db/mock_sqlite.db < db/mock_data_for_sqlite.sql`

```python
```shell
# Telegram Bot configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
TELEGRAM_URL=https://api.telegram.org/bot

# Database configuration (example for SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
SQLITE_URL=your_sqlite_database_url
POSTGRES_URL=your_postgres_database_url #not supported yet

# Personalization settings for SQL dialect
SQL_DIALECT=sqlite   # or 'postgres' not supported 
```
## Assistant Tools
> See [TOOLS.md](src/real_time_api_async/TOOLS.md) for a detailed list of available tools and their descriptions.

## Personalization

You can customize the behavior of the assistant by modifying the `personalization.json` file. Here are the available options:

- `ai_assistant_name`: The name of the AI assistant.
- `patient_name`: The name of the human user.
- `sql_dialect`: The SQL dialect to use for database operations. Supported options are:
  - `sqlite`: For SQLite databases
  - `postgres`: For PostgreSQL databases (untested)
- `system_message_suffix`: A string that will be appended to the end of the system instructions for the AI assistant.

Example `personalization.json`:

```json
{
  "ai_assistant_name": "Ada",
  "sql_dialect": "sqlite",
  "patient_name": "John Doe",
  "missing_data": [
    "last_name"
  ],
  "system_message_suffix": "Always be helpful and concise in your responses."
}
```

The `system_message_suffix` allows you to add custom instructions or personality traits to open AI. This suffix will be appended to the end of the default system instructions, giving usmore control over how the model behaves and responds.


# Voice Recognition with AI ‚Äì Prototypes Comparison

### Models

- **Whisper**: OpenAI's Speech-to-Text (STT) model.
- **TTS**: OpenAI's Text-to-Speech model.
- **VAD**: Voice Activity Detection model.
- **GPT-4o**: OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 model.
- **Real-Time API**: Custom API for real-time voice processing.

This application uses Streamlit, the OpenAI API, and Python to create an interactive voice recognition system. The workflow is simple: the user speaks, the system converts speech to text via an API, processes the text with AI, and then converts the response back to speech. 

For our proof-of-concept (POC), we developed three distinct prototypes:

1. **Streamlit with Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech with OpenAI**  
2. **Real Streaming with Twill (Twilio)**  
3. **Real Time API with Functions**

Below you'll find a comparison of these prototypes along with their respective pros and cons, as well as a Mermaid diagram visualizing the workflow.
